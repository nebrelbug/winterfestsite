        <p class='contentText'>“ComPro 2019 was AMAZING!! The students and I learned so much together. This course was
            life-changing for many of us because we learned the skills to build websites, thus empowering us with
            greater power to influence the world for good. Every single one of us learned - not because we were forced
            to do so, not because we were bribed to do so, but because we wanted to do so. To me, this is one of the
            magical ingredients of Winterim - individuals choosing to study something they are passionate about.”

        <h2 class='heading1'>Class Graph</h2>
        <p class='contentText1'>Before Christmas break, students were asked to personally rate their knowledge of
            programming on a scale of 1-10. Approximately half the class reported a score of 2 or below. Students were
            also told to give 20 hours of their winter break learning CSS, Javascript, and HTML using a free website
            called “Codecademy.” <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/learn' target='_blank'>(https://www.codecademy.com/)</a>
            Near the end of Winterim, students were again asked to rate their knowledge of programming. The chart on
            the *left* shows how much their knowledge improved during Winterim.

    <div class='content1'>
        <h2 class='heading'>Personal Websites</h2>
        <p class='contentText'>Using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, students spent hours coding from scratch to create
            unique websites intended to better themselves and their community. On the very first day of Winterim each
            student was assigned a partner to work with. If a problem were to occur, the students were instructed to
            try their hardest with google before turning to their partner or asking others for help. Compro students
            would agree that most of the time used for their website creation was spent fixing code and solving
            problems. Throughout this process students have learned how to solve problems using the resources they
            already have. They saw first hand that the internet has great value beyond just entertainment.

        <h2 class='heading1'>Downtime Activities</h2>
        <p class='contentText1'>On an Adobe field trip, Compro received the message to “work hard. Play hard.” Despite
            the endless capabilities of programming, big companies like Adobe know work can sometimes be tedious. They
            seek to optimize their environment for employee satisfaction by including recreation, games, and food. We
            especially enjoyed the spacious computer game room in the basement. Teenager heaven!
            Lunch breaks are crucial in any work environment. The entire Compro class enjoyed multiple lunches and
            snacks provided by Winterim fees. Papa John’s and Panda Express were the favorites! Compro watched many
            episodes of “Splatalot” on BYU-TV and played multiple indoor frisbee games with Mr.Gilbert whose team often
            lost.
            “These activities were important to recharge batteries, and keep students motivated.”

        <p class='contentText'>“We were fortunate to receive guidance, insight, and direction from many professionals
            in the programming and web development world. These include Michael Olsen of XactWare, Nate Zobrist of
            Finicity, Hector Pina of Acima Credit, Ryan Heaton of Family Search, Dustin Christensen of Western
            Governors University, and Dirk Giles of MicroFocus. Additionally, the class had the opportunity to go to
            the Adobe Campus in Lehi for a tour.”
